# 🚀 Sanic Backend Boilerplate

A lightweight, high-performance API boilerplate built with the Sanic framework.

## 📖 About

This boilerplate provides a minimal setup for creating a REST API using the [Sanic](https://sanic.dev/en/) framework. Sanic is an async Python web server that's built to be fast, simple, and easy to use.

Sanic allows for asynchronous request handling, making it ideal for I/O-bound applications that require high throughput.

### Environment Setup

You can use any of the following methods to set up your environment:

#### Using venv (Python's built-in virtual environment)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Using conda

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n sanic-boilerplate python=3.9

# Activate the environment
conda activate sanic-boilerplate
```

### Installing Requirements

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Managing Requirements

1. To add new requirements:
   - Add the package name to `requirements.txt`
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Alternatively, install directly and update requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install package-name
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Server

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.
